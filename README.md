# SequencedSet

!IMPORTANT!: Make sure to create a branch when you make any edits to existing files. Then, we can remerge the branch- but we don't want multiple people editing the same file and pushing their changes to the master branch, overwriting each other.
If you are just writing new files, then you can instead just push the new files to the master branch.
